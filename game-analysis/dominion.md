# Dominion - expanded

## Synopsis

In Dominion, each player starts with an identical hand of of card representing a few victory points and money.
In the center of the table is a "kingdom", which is a shared set of cards players can "buy" to construct a deck on the fly.

Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.
The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play‚Äîleading to immense variety.

### Objects

This is an almost entirely card based game, with a few random small tokens used in some game types.


### Analysis

While a fun game, it does not lend itself to the TTOS format.
