# Flash Point

## Synopsis

In Flash Point, players attempt to rescue victims from raging fires.
As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building,
causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building.

Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building,
 move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles.

If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.
 Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.
